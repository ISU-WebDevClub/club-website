                <h2>History</h2>

                <p>The first semester of the club's existence started out with a bang! Our numbers grew rapidly, and everyone
                    was eager to get started. As expected, there was a massive amount of interest in the club even before we
                    began to promote ourselves. "I'm surprised there wasn't already a Web Development Club," was a common
                    expression when we told others about the club. People of all skill levels joined and brought a wide range of
                    skills to the table.<br></p>

                            The club was officially recognized on August 24, 2015. At that time, there were only eight members.

                            The first meeting was held September 2nd, 2015 in Coover Hall. The weather was nice, so we moved out
                            to
                            the courtyard to celebrate the club's founding with some soda and cookies. There were nine members
                            in
                            attendance, and we all had high hopes of doing great things with the club.

                            up
                            for the mailing list. Membership more than doubled. In addition, we networked with other clubs and
                            found
                            out there was a huge interest in web development services around campus and around town. We would
                            soon
                            have our hands full!

                            hackathon. Sleep was lost, caffeine was consumed, and Nicolas Cage image placeholders were used in
                            abundance.
