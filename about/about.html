      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        The first semester of the club's existence started out with a bang! Our numbers grew rapidly, and everyone
        was eager to get started. As expected, there was a massive amount of interest in the club even before we
        began to promote ourselves. "I'm surprised there wasn't already a Web Development Club," was a common
        expression when we told others about the club. People of all skill levels joined and brought a wide range of
        skills to the table.

              The club was officially recognized on August 24, 2015. At that
              time, there were only eight members.

              The first meeting was held September 2nd, 2015 in Coover Hall. The weather was nice, so we moved out to
              the courtyard to celebrate the club's founding with some soda and cookies. There were nine members in
              attendance, and we all had high hopes of doing great things with the club.

              The club made its first public appearance at the Fall 2015 ClubFest. We had sixty-eight people sign up
              for the mailing list. Membership more than doubled. In addition, we networked with other clubs and found
              out there was a huge interest in web development services around campus and around town. We would soon have our hands full!

              On September 19, 2015 we made excellent progress on the club website at HackISU, Iowa State's annual
              hackathon. Sleep was lost, caffeine was consumed, and Nicolas Cage image placeholders were used in
              abundance.

              We completed our first project as a team, the creation of a website for a local dentist
              in Iowa. This project gave club members an opportunity to sharpen their skills while
              contributing to the local community.
